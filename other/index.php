            <h3>I read tarot</h3>
            <p>I've been working with tarot privately since 2014, and reading professionally since 2022. I offer individual readings, in person or over zoom, for either 30 or 60 minutes. I also read at parties and events!</p>

            <p>I can be booked through <a href="https://www.calleynelson.com/service-page/new-online-readings-w-brendan-landis">Extraordinary Tarot</a>.</p>

            <h3>I play in bands</h3>

            <p>I write songs (and sing, and play guitar) for my art rock band <a href="https://receive.blue/">Receive</a>. I also play drums in my girlfriend's band <a href="https://starcard.bandcamp.com/album/freak-world-ep">Star Card</a>. Lastly, we write songs together as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/__receiver/">Receiver</a>.</p>

            <h3>I teach music</h3>
            <p>
                I teach and coach about a range of musical skills and topics:
            <ul>
                <li>Techniques for guitar / bass / voice.</li>
                <li>Fitting practice into one's already-too-busy life.</li>
                <li>Studio design and setup. Getting a realistic and unobtrusive workflow together using one's existing gear and budget.</li>
                <li>Getting unstuck with songs / tracks / compositions / EPs / albums. Workshopping a piece to bring it to completion &amp; publishing, using one's existing gear, skills, and setup.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>I'm also available to mix, master, engineer, or produce recordings.</p>

            <p>If you'd like to talk about lessons or coaching, by all means <a href="&#x6D;a&#105;&#x6C;t&#111;&colon;b&#64;&#115;lo&#x77;&#110;am&#101;s&period;&#110;e&#x74;" title="email me">get in touch</a>.</p>
