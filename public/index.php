            <p>
                I'm a self-taught designer and front-end developer with over
                twenty years of experience, living in Queens, NY. I wrote my
                first lines of HTML in 1997, and started making things
                professionally in the early 2000s.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, projects I've worked on have ranged from startups to
                multinationals, from static sites to
                <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>-compliant,
                <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>-driven,
                internationally available stores with multilingual support,
                including right-to-left languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like making things that are accessible and welcoming for
                everyone. That means creating a user experience that's easy,
                inclusive, and painless &mdash; whatever my role in a project
                may be.
            </p>
            <p>
